Antilackware is supposed to be a transient repository of slackbuilds.
A slackbuild is the preferred way for preparing software packages for
Slackware Linux.  See  http://www.slackware.com for details of this
superb distribution.

Slackware is known from avoiding so called 'dependency hell' simply by 
making the administrator responsible for taking care of software
dependencies.  On the other hand this makes trimming down and 
customising the system somehow easier.
