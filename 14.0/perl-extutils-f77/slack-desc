perl-extutils-f77: This module tries to figure out how to link C programs
perl-extutils-f77: with Fortran subroutines on your system. Basically
perl-extutils-f77: one must add a list of Fortran runtime libraries. The
perl-extutils-f77: problem is their location and name varies with each
perl-extutils-f77: OS/compiler combination!
